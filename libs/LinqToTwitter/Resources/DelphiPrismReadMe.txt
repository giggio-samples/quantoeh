Read Me for Delphi Prism
------------------------

The examples in this demo use the oxygene compiler, which you can download for free from Embarcadero's site at: cc.codegear.com/free/prism.  If they move the link, look for trial downloads for Delphi Prism or check the Rem Objects site at http://www.remobjects.com/.

After you install the Oxygene compiler, go to the Start menu, All Programs, Delphi Prism, and run the Oxygen Command Prompt.  Then navigate to where you have the Delphi Prism demos for LINQ to Twitter and run the BuildDelphiPrismDemo.bat file.

This will create a file named DelpiPrismDemo.exe, which you can run.  You can view the source code in the file named DelphiPrismDemo.pas.
